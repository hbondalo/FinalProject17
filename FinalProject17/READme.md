    Escape Magnet is a user-friendly game in which the user takes the role of a graduating high school student.
The problem is that the student is stuck in Magnet and needs to get to AIT for graduation. In order to get to
AIT, the student faces various teachers for various levels in which the student must surpass to continue in the
game. Three wrong moves and you lose the game. If the user answers a question right, he/she is able to get items
into their inventory as points that will be accumulated at the end of the game (should the user complete all levels)
which will determine their future after graduation. Using classes, multiple defined functions and inputs, and a plethora
of commenting, Escape Magnet provides an interactive experience to give insight about Magnet life.
